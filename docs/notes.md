## Notes

* Detached from `lua-stuff` for easy editing, and I felt it deserved it's own repo.
* Use the cool github pages site to read about this creation: https://cozzybro2.github.io/CallScheduler/
* If you care at all for some reason, this is intended to replace `delay()` moreso than it is to replace `wait()`.
