# CallScheduler
Roblox module that allows accurate scheduling of lua functions (calls) with more digestible syntax when compared to alternatives.

## Notes

* Detached from `lua-stuff` for easy editing, and I felt it deserved it's own repo.
* Use the cool github pages site to read about this creation: https://cozzybro2.github.io/CallScheduler/
